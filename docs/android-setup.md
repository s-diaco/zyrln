# Android Setup

The Android app runs the relay proxy directly on your phone — no desktop needed once it's configured.

## Before You Start

Complete the relay setup first:
- [Apps Script deployed](../README.md#step-2--deploy-the-apps-script-relay)
- [Exit relay running](../README.md#step-3--deploy-the-exit-relay) (VPS or Cloudflare)

## Install the App

Download the APK from the [Releases](../../releases) page and install it on your phone.

If Android blocks the install: **Settings → Install unknown apps** → allow your file manager.

## First-Time Setup

### 1. Import your config

The easiest way is from the desktop app:

1. In the desktop app, click the **export** (download) button in the Tools section
2. Copy the JSON that appears
3. On your phone, tap **Import Config from Clipboard**

The config is saved automatically. You can import multiple configs from different relay setups and switch between them.

**If you don't have the desktop app**, create the JSON manually:

```json
{"url":"https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_ID/exec","key":"YOUR_AUTH_KEY"}
```

For multiple Apps Script URLs (better resilience):

```json
{"url":"https://script.google.com/.../exec1,https://script.google.com/.../exec2","key":"YOUR_AUTH_KEY"}
```

### 2. Install the CA Certificate

Required for HTTPS sites. Skip this if you only need HTTP sites.

1. Tap **Install CA Certificate** in the app
2. The cert is saved to `Downloads/zyrln-ca.pem`
3. Tap **Open Settings** when prompted
4. Go to **Biometrics & security → Other security settings → Install from device storage**
   - On stock Android: **Settings → Security → Encryption & credentials → Install a certificate → CA certificate**
5. Browse to Downloads, select `zyrln-ca.pem`
6. Choose **CA certificate** when asked what type

> ⚠️ Never copy the `.pem` file from your computer to your phone. Each device generates its own unique CA. Using the wrong certificate causes SSL errors. Always use the **Install CA Certificate** button inside the app.

### 3. Connect

1. Tap a config in the list to select it (it highlights)
2. Tap the **connect** button (power icon, top right)
3. Allow VPN permission when Android asks
4. The button turns green — you're connected

To disconnect: tap the connect button again.

## Direct Mode (Google Services)

The **⚡ lightning bolt** button enables direct mode — Google services (YouTube, Gmail, Drive) connect directly to Google with fragmented TLS instead of going through the relay. Faster and uses less quota.

Enable it by tapping the lightning bolt (it turns green). Works independently from the relay — you can have both active at once.

## Ping

Tap **ping** to measure relay round-trip time. Uses the currently selected or active config. Useful for comparing multiple relay deployments.

## Building the APK Yourself

Requires Android Studio with NDK installed.

```bash
# Install gomobile (once)
go install golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile@latest
gomobile init

# Build
make keystore        # generate signing key (once)
make android         # signed release APK

# Debug build (no keystore needed)
make android-debug
```

APK location: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/`

## Troubleshooting

**SSL errors on HTTPS sites**
The CA certificate is not installed or not trusted. Repeat step 2. On Samsung devices, the path may be under **Biometrics & security → Other security settings**.

**Some apps don't work through the proxy**
Apps that hardcode their own TLS certificates (banking apps, some payment apps) ignore the system proxy. This cannot be fixed without root access.

**VPN permission denied**
Go to **Settings → Apps → Zyrln → Permissions** and grant VPN access manually.

**Config not connecting**
Run the desktop **Diagnostics** tool to verify the relay chain is working before importing to Android.
